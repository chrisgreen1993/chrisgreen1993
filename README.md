# 👋 Hey there, I'm Chris!

I'm a full-stack software engineer specialising in web technologies.

I'm currently working with TypeScript and React @ [Goodnotes][https://www.goodnotes.com/)

Previously I've worked with TypeScript and React at [Typeform](http://www.typeform.com), and have experience with Clojure at [Relish](http://www.hellorelish.com), as well as Ruby on Rails at [FreeAgent](http://www.freeagent.com).

I also run a little music discovery app called [Listen List](http://www.listenlist.app)
