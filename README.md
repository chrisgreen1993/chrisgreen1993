# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Chris!

I'm a full-stack software engineer specialising in web technologies.

I'm currently working with TypeScript and React Native at [Enlock](enlock.com) to build a fully encrypted online workspace.

Previously I've worked with TypeScript and React at [Typeform](typeform.com), and have experience with Clojure at [Relish](hellorelish.com), as well as Ruby on Rails at [FreeAgent](freeagent.com).

I also run a little music discovery app called Listen List, and have a couple of other small projects here on GitHub.

Feel free to check out my [website](chrisgreen.codes), or shoot me an email at [chrisgreen1993@gmail.com](mailto:chrisgreen1993@gmail.com)
